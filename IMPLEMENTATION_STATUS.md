## üîß Environment Variables Status

### ‚úÖ Configured Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` ‚úÖ
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚úÖ
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs to be renamed, see below)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Variables That Need Corrections
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` ‚Üí Should be `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

### ‚ùå Missing Required Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string from Supabase (Project Settings > Database)
- `SPHERE_API_KEY` - Your Sphere API key from Sphere dashboard
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Random secret key for session encryption (generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional (But Recommended) Variables
- `SPHERE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook secret for verifying Sphere webhooks
  - **Note:** You'll need a public URL (via ngrok or Vercel deployment) to configure webhooks in Sphere dashboard
  - Webhook endpoint: `/api/webhooks/sphere`
  - Can be set up later after deployment

### üìù Optional But Recommended Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPHERE_ENV` - Set to `sandbox` for development or `production` for production (defaults to sandbox if not set)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your app URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for dev)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Variables Not Used (Can Be Removed)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` - Not used in codebase
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPHERE_APPLICATION_ID` - Not used in codebase
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPHERE_CUSTOMER_ID` - Not used in codebase

## üîß To Run the Project

1. ‚úÖ Setup Supabase project and get credentials
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Create `.env.local` with all required variables (see above and SETUP.md)
3. Run `pnpm install`
4. Run `pnpm prisma:push` to create database tables
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start development server
6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and create an account

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Database Migrations**: You need to run Prisma push/migrate before first use
2. **Environment Variables**: All Supabase and Sphere keys must be configured (except webhooks which can be set up later)
3. **Sphere Sandbox**: Use sandbox environment for testing
4. **Solana Devnet**: Testing should use Solana devnet, not mainnet
5. **Webhooks**: Webhooks require a publicly accessible URL. For local development:
   - Use ngrok to expose `localhost:3000` (see SETUP.md)
   - Or deploy to Vercel first and use the deployment URL
   - Webhooks are optional for initial testing - you can test payment creation without them

## üìä Estimated Remaining Time

- Dashboard UI completion: 2-3 hours
- Payment modal & onboarding: 1-2 hours
- Subscriptions (Loop Crypto): 2-3 hours
- Testing & bug fixes: 2-3 hours
- Deployment: 1 hour

**Total remaining: ~10-12 hours** to complete MVP

## üéâ Progress Summary

**Overall Progress: ~60% Complete**

- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (100%)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Authentication (100%)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Sphere Integration (100%)
- üöß Phase 4: Dashboard (40%)
