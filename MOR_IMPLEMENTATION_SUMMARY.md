# SphereRamp MOR Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Merchant of Record (MOR) payment system using SphereRamp widget where the platform collects payments on behalf of merchants and handles tax calculation and settlement.

## What Was Implemented

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added MOR-specific fields to the Payment model:
- `platformWalletReceived` - Tracks if payment received by platform

- `invoiceNumber` - Unique invoice identifier
- `settlementStatus`, `settledAt` - Merchant settlement tracking

**Migration:** Database schema pushed successfully with `prisma db push`

## Architecture

### Payment Flow

```
1. Merchant creates payment link
   ↓
2. System generates checkout URL: /checkout/[paymentId]
   ↓
3. Customer visits checkout page
   ↓
4. System detects/selects customer country
   ↓
5. Tax calculated based on country
   ↓
6. Customer sees breakdown: subtotal + tax = total
   ↓
7. SphereRamp widget loads
   ↓
8. Customer pays with USDC
   ↓
9. Payment received by platform wallet
   ↓
10. Invoice generated with tax details
    ↓
11. Customer sees receipt
    ↓
12. Merchant sees pending settlement
    ↓
13. Platform settles with merchant (7-14 days)
```

### MOR Model Benefits

1. **Platform Collects Payment:** All payments go to platform wallet first
2. **Tax Compliance:** Automatic tax calculation by customer country
3. **Settlement Control:** Platform controls when to settle with merchants
